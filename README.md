       The project is compiled into a single .exe file.

      A unique message encryption system is used.
          Version 1.4 adds SEED System! Making encryption variations virtually endless even for 5-letter words.

          -----Old versions----
          For example: a 5-letter word can be encrypted in 10,000,000,000 different ways.
       A 10-letter word can be encrypted in 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 differnt ways.
       And this can easily be increased thousands of times over, but thereâ€™s no need.
       ---------------------------
          
            Encryption and decryption happen instantly.
            
            
               Atmospheric emojis included ðŸ’žðŸ‘ 
               
      AI-resistant cipher protection.

        - The cipher is created in the format: ðŸ’‹ ðŸ’‹ ðŸ’‹ ðŸ’‹ ðŸ’‹ - 1 1 1 1 1
        
       - The cipher consists of emojis and a key.
       
       - Each cipher generation creates a unique combination of emojis/key.
       
       - To decrypt, paste the emojis into the "Mood" window and the key into the "Mood key" window.
       
      No internet connection required.
                                
      Anyone who receives this cipher will only be able to decrypt 
                it using the exact same version of the program as yours.
                                
        Version compatibility for ciphers: 
        1.0 is compatible with 1.1
        1.2 is currently only compatible with 1.2
        1.3 is currently only compatible with 1.3

                                                   ----ðŸ”´----
                                                                                          
                                                   Happy usage.

      Also, a special thank you if you decide to test it out.
